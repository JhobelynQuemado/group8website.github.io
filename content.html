      <h3 class="feature-title">What is Streaming?</h3>
      <p>A multimedia file that can be played instantly without having to be downloaded first is referred to as streaming. 
        If a piece of media, whether recorded or live, can be viewed online and played on any device without being downloaded, 
        it is considered a streamed content. It works through a continuous transmission of the media content from a server to the client.  
        Prior to beginning our journey in streaming, we decide first on our content type for our stream and we choose our topic. 
        In order to generate ideas and conduct preliminary research on the various streaming platforms, we employed the Design Thinking Process. 
        By employing the Design Thinking Process, this will help and make streaming more familiar to us and help us learn more about it.</p>

            those are Podcasts, Informative Videos, and Educational Videos. We then chose Podcasts among the three of them during our EGs 5-6.

        <h3 class="feature-title">What are the characteristics of a good stream?</h3>
          <p><h6>
            Engaging with the audience<br>Being consistent with the information and subject matter you want your audience or viewers to see. 
            <br>Social interactivity with viewers<br>Providing a safe and healthy space for the viewers<br>Influential in a good way

        <h3 class="feature-title">Needs of Viewers</h3>
          <p>During our EGs 5-6, we learned about the needs of the viewers. Below are some of them: <h6>
           to understand that students are significantly influenced by online games.
           <br>to understand that online games can affect your mental health, academics, and social behavior.
           <br>to know and understand the importance and benefits when it comes to practicing time management between playing online games and studying. 
           <br>to know that it depends on a student as well whether playing online games affects their academics because itâ€™s up to them <br>how they manage 
           their time effectively and correctly. 
            </p></div>


            <div class="charac">
                <h3 class="feature-title">Viewers Analysis for Each Streaming Category</h3>
                  <p>We conducted a survey for 32 students in our EG 3-4, and the result showed that 46.9% of respondents preferred Informative Videos, 
                    34.4% preferred Podcasts, <br>and 18.8% preferred Educational Videos. Although the majority of the respondents preferred Informative Videos 
                    as our content type, we have decided to stick with Podcasts<br> as our content type. Why so? We chose Podcasts as our content type because 
                    Podcasts are more adaptable than trying to watch a video while doing something. <br>Podcasts have a far better technique of reaching our audience, 
                    which is why we chose them as our content type. Due to the ability to listen at one's own pace, <br>Podcasts encourage greater engagement. 
                    Perhaps one of the greatest pedagogic characteristics offered by educational podcasting is the chance to learn through listening. 
                    <br>To many of the current student generation, learning through listening is enjoyable and less tedious than reading.
